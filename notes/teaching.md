### experience

i love facilitating learning. working with engaged students to solve a problem or generate new insight and understanding is one of the greatest joys i know.

while i’ve worked in both public and private learning environments and with learners of all ages and backgrounds, the majority of my experience is in skills-beads training for adult learners.

i’ve designed and taught courses in programming and web development, ranging in length from a few of weeks to 9 months. in addition, i’ve written curricula for classroom and online learning that has reached thousands of students.

### principles and methods

without formal training in education, i’ve had to learn from experience, self-study, and the support of other more knowledgable and skilled educators. learning about learning and teaching is a never-ending process.

with experience, study, and reflection, i have come to develop a preference for certain principles and methods, most of which would roughly fall under the umbrella of a constructivist theory of learning. these include:

- project-based and discovery-driven learning
- promoting learner agency and engagement in their own learning process
- an outcomes-first approach to curriculum design
